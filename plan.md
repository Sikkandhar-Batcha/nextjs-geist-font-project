Below is a detailed implementation plan outlining all changes and new files with error handling and best practices. Follow the steps below to integrate a public website for Spicy Trolly and a separate Node.js backend service for admin functions, email notifications, and database integration.

---

## Architecture Overview

- The frontend is built with Next.js (using the app router) under the src/app folder. It comprises a public landing page with sections for About, Menu, Contact, and an Order Booking form.  
- The admin routes (under src/app/admin) include a Login page, Dashboard, Products management, and a Reports section with pie/bar charts (using Recharts).  
- A separate Node.js backend (in a new “backend” folder) will serve APIs for admin login, product CRUD, order submissions (including email notifications via Nodemailer), and report data, connecting to MongoDB.  
- Environment variables (in a .env file) will hold sensitive keys for MongoDB and SMTP credentials.  
- All API endpoints expose appropriate error handling with try-catch blocks (frontend shows error messages and loading states; backend uses Express error middleware).

---

## Frontend – Next.js Changes

### 1. Landing Page and Order Booking Form  
- **File:** `src/app/page.tsx`  
  - Create a landing page that displays the shop name (“Spicy Trolly”), a brief about section, a detailed menu listing the items (chicken thokku Biriyani, Chilli Biriyani, etc.), contact information, and an integrated order booking form.  
  - Use semantic HTML elements and Tailwind CSS for modern styling (typography, spacing, layout).  
  - Implement client-side validation (required fields, proper email format).  
  - On submit, POST order data to a (proxy or direct) backend API (i.e. `http://localhost:5000/api/orders`).

- **Component:** `src/components/OrderForm.tsx`  
  - Create a reusable order form.  
  - Include error handling (display error messages if request fails) and success confirmation.

### 2. Admin Login and Dashboard UI

- **File:** `src/app/admin/login/page.tsx`  
  - Create a login form with fields for email and password.  
  - POST credentials to the backend API (`http://localhost:5000/api/login`).  
  - Display error messages for invalid credentials using state and Tailwind styling.

- **File:** `src/app/admin/dashboard/page.tsx`  
  - Create a dashboard layout with a sidebar (using a simple list of text links, styled with Tailwind) that navigates to Products, Raw Products, and Reports.  
  - Implement session handling (storing a JWT in cookies or localStorage).  
  - Provide a logout option.

- **File:** `src/app/admin/products/page.tsx`  
  - Develop a CRUD interface that lists products and offers forms/modals for add, update, and delete.
  - Use React hooks for API calls and provide visual confirmation dialogs with proper error states.
  
- **File:** `src/app/admin/reports/page.tsx`  
  - Create a page that displays pie and bar charts using the Recharts library.  
  - Fetch monthly, weekly, and daily report data from the backend API and handle loading states and errors.

## Backend – Node.js/MongoDB/Nodemailer Service (New Folder “backend”)

### 1. Folder & Basic Setup

- **New Folder:** `/backend`  
  - Create a `package.json` to include dependencies: express, mongoose, nodemailer, cors, dotenv, body-parser.
  - Create an `.env` file to store `MONGODB_URI`, `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASS`, and `ADMIN_EMAILS` (as comma-separated values).

### 2. Server Initialization

- **File:** `/backend/server.js`  
  - Initialize Express, enable CORS, body parsing.
  - Connect to MongoDB using Mongoose (errors logged; retry mechanism can be implemented).
  - Import routes and mount them on `/api` endpoints.
  - Add a global error handler middleware to catch and log errors with proper status codes.

### 3. API Routes Implementation

- **File:** `/backend/routes/auth.js`  
  - Define a POST `/api/login` route.  
  - Validate credentials (dummy hardcoded admin check or from a collection) and return a signed JWT.
  
- **File:** `/backend/routes/products.js`  
  - Implement endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for products management (menu items) with proper validation and error handling.

- **File:** `/backend/routes/orders.js`  
  - Create a POST `/api/orders` endpoint.  
  - Store order details in MongoDB and, using Nodemailer (imported from a config file), send an email notification to all admin emails.  
  - Use try-catch to handle email failures and DB errors.

- **File:** `/backend/routes/reports.js`  
  - Create a GET endpoint to return dummy or computed report data (sales, purchases, profit/loss) for charts.

### 4. Config Files

- **File:** `/backend/config/db.js`  
  - Export a Mongoose connection function with error logging.
  
- **File:** `/backend/config/mailer.js`  
  - Configure and export a Nodemailer transporter using the values from .env.

## Testing & Best Practices

- Use curl commands to test backend endpoints (login, product CRUD, order submission) and validate status codes, response messages, and file outputs.  
- In the frontend, handle API call failures gracefully showing spinner/loading and error messages.  
- Validate inputs both client- and server-side.  
- Secure admin routes with JWT verification middleware in backend routes.  
- Use clean component separation and ensure a modern, responsive UI using Tailwind CSS with attention to spacing, typography, and layout.

## Summary

- The plan introduces a Next.js public site with sections for shop info, a modern order form, and admin routes for login, product management, and reports.  
- A separate Node.js backend connects to MongoDB, handles authentication (JWT), product CRUD, order storage, and emails via Nodemailer.  
- New files include frontend pages in src/app and backend code under /backend with routes and configuration.  
- Both backend and frontend include robust error handling, validation, and secure practices.  
- Modern UI/UX is ensured with Tailwind styling and responsive design without external icon libraries.
